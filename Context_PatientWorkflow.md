### Patient Workflow & Change Detection

- Patient exchange workflow spans 5 minutes typically
  - Patient ID information remains static throughout - no automatic tracking
  - Manual detection required when table moves down/up
- Detailed workflow sequence:
  - Head coil elements reduce from 4 to 2 when opened
  - Only possible patient exit after coil opening
- Hardware events more reliable than software commands
  - Light positioning system provides calibration before scan entry
  - Coil changes provide clear detection signals
