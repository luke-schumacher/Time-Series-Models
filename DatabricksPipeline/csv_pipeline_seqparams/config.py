csv_pipeline_seqparams/config.py — feature-rich examination-duration pipeline.

Forked from DatabricksPipeline/csv_pipeline/config.py to add MRI_SUT_1005
sequence-protocol parameters (TR, number of slices, trigger/gating mode) as
extra conditioning features for the examination duration model — per the
call with Görtler (domain expert): "scanning time" itself must NEVER be used
as an input feature, since it is ~equal to the duration target (leakage).

Scoped to the SAME 10 serial numbers / date range as csv_pipeline/, so the
old and new models are directly comparable on identical held-out data. Does
NOT modify csv_pipeline/ or AlternatingPipeline/config.py — the old model
and its checkpoint are completely untouched by this fork. Constants below
are duplicated (not cross-imported) from csv_pipeline/config.py, matching
that file's own established convention for this codebase.

*** STATUS ***
sut_parameter_discovery.py has been run against real MRI_SUT_1005 data. The
originally-hypothesized labeled "SD<n>: value" format was FALSIFIED (0/20
real messages matched) — the real format is whitespace-delimited, self-named
"KEY:VALUE" tokens (e.g. "TR:866 TE:101 SLC:9 ... MUID:17"). TR and num_slices
(mapped from the "SLC" key) are CONFIRMED via SUT_FIELD_MAP below.

WHICH parameters reach the model is now a single switch, PARAM_SET, defined
immediately below this docstring: two named sets (`luke`, the acquisition-time
formula; `navneet`, the 2026-08-04 domain-expert selection) drawn from one
SEQPARAM_CANDIDATES table. trigger_mode remains a PLACEHOLDER —
no field in the sampled messages showed variation consistent with a
gating/trigger mode (candidates CMM/CDM/RCM/PHYS/PAC were constant across all
samples), so TRIGGER_MODE_VOCAB is unused for now and every row defaults to
'none' (safe, non-leaking default — see _trigger_mode_id below).

# ============================================================================
# PARAM_SET — WHICH PARAMETERS GO INTO THE MODEL. The one switch.
#
# Görtler's action item from the 2026-08-04 call: "there isn't really a clear
# part of the code where you can select which parameters are put into the
# model, it's mostly they are split up ... that we can run two different model
# results, based on two parameter selections."
#
# This file is the only one all seven notebooks %run, and 03/04/05/06/07 all
# read EXAMINATION_SEQPARAM_FEATURES / EXAMINATION_SEQPARAM_SCALE / MODELS_DIR
# / ANALYSIS_DIR from here. Resolving those four from PARAM_SET reaches every
# call site without editing any of them.
#
# The named sets are defined in PARAM_SETS, further down next to the candidate
# table they draw from. Override without editing this file:
#
#     PARAM_SET=navneet   (env var, same convention as PKL_PATH / TARGET_MAE_S)
#
# Models and analysis output are namespaced by this value — see MODELS_DIR /
# ANALYSIS_DIR below — so two runs never overwrite each other's checkpoint.
#
# THE DEFAULT IS 'all' as of the 2026-08-07 Görtler meeting. His position is
# that a digital twin aiming at the extraordinary 1% cannot hide fields from
# itself: rare cases are rare BECAUSE they turn on fields that are constant on
# the other 99%, so hand-picking on aggregate MAE deletes the tail signal. 03f
# had already found the same thing — its ranked top-12 beat both hand-picked
# sets. `luke` and `navneet` are kept as the control group, because "more is
# better" is a claim to be measured rather than assumed.

# TARGET SCANNERS & DATE RANGE
#
# 21 SERIALS since 2026-08-11, matching csv_pipeline after PR #59 — so the
# like-for-like comparison against the old model holds again. Decided in the
# 08-11 review, which also ruled AGAINST going straight to 40: adding too many
# at once makes a result impossible to attribute.
#
# WHY 21 IS THE RUN THAT MATTERS. The 08-11 parameter report had to call the
# <1% question undecidable, and the reason was arithmetic rather than method:
# roughly doubling the corpus roughly doubles every rare field's row count,
# which is what makes ~13 of the 37 rare fields learnable for the first time.
# It does NOT rescue the genuinely rare end — PDM was on 7 rows at 10 serials
# and lands near 15 here, where a useful count is in the hundreds.
#
# WHICH IS WHY 40 MUST BE CHOSEN, NOT COUNTED UP TO. The same review's
# conclusion: pick customers whose scans CONTAIN the rare combinations — a site
# doing mainly cardiac work — rather than the next 19 serials off the list. A
# rare parameter stays rare at any corpus size if nobody in the corpus runs the
# sequence that uses it. The remaining 19 candidates are in csv_pipeline's
# config as a comment; they are candidates, not a queue.

# from csv_pipeline's pkl and its exchange/orchestration checkpoints from
# csv_pipeline's models directory. That is the reason onboarding a new customer
# currently means running BOTH pipelines and keeping them in sync.
#
# The fix is for step 03 to produce all four keys, which absorbs
# 01_exchange_preprocessing.py and 02_exam_preprocessing.py. That is deliberately
# NOT done yet: Navneet is reworking csv_pipeline for a GPU cluster, and forking
# those two now means forking code that is being rewritten and then re-forking it
# after his PR lands.
#
# What IS done now is making the dependency a NAMED CONSTANT instead of two
# string literals buried at 07:181-183, so the day the merge happens it is a
# config change rather than a code change — and so `grep BASE_` finds every
# place this pipeline still leans on the other one.

# of this fork) queries Spark directly and never reads step 02's CSV; that
# CSV only ever fed csv_pipeline/03's Section 3 (customer_schedules), which

# SUT SEQUENCE-PARAMETER VOCAB & FEATURE LIST
#
# Confirmed via DatabricksPipeline/sut_parameter_discovery.py against real
# MRI_SUT_1005 data (Jan 2024, serials 183242/176148/176227). The message is
# whitespace-delimited "KEY:VALUE" tokens, self-named per field (e.g. TR, TE,
# SLC, SLT, FA, ...) — NOT the originally-hypothesized numbered "SD<n>: value"
# scheme, which matched 0/20 real messages. Field sets differ by sequence
# type (haste vs. ep2d_diff carry different key sets entirely), so there is
# no fixed slot count to index into — SUT_FIELD_MAP looks fields up BY NAME.
#
# 'SLC' -> 'num_slices': confirmed by inspection (values 9/15/18 match
# plausible slice counts; a separate 'SLT' key already carries slice
# *thickness*, ruling out the alternative reading). 'TR' needs no renaming —
# it's the standard MR repetition-time mnemonic already.
#
# trigger_mode is NOT yet mapped: none of the candidate fields (CMM, CDM,
# RCM, PHYS, PAC) varied across the sampled messages, so there's no evidence
# which (if any) encodes gating/trigger mode. Follow up with Navneet. Until
# then every row defaults to 'none' via _trigger_mode_id's fallback — a
# constant, uninformative embedding, not a bug.
#
# scanning_time (the original SD58 leakage concern) does not correspond to
# any literal field in this KEY:VALUE format — there's no "SD" label at all.
# SUT_LEAKAGE_DENYLIST is kept below as defense-in-depth regardless.
# ============================================================================

# raw message key -> stable parameter name.
#
# Fields below TR/num_slices are PARSED but do NOT reach the model: only names
# listed in EXAMINATION_SEQPARAM_FEATURES do. They land in each sequence's
# audit-only `sut_debug` so the within-protocol residual (sd 25.7s after
# conditioning on protocol) can be analysed without another Spark rebuild.
#
# Why this set: acquisition time is roughly TR x PEL x AVG x CONC /
# (PAT x TF), so TR is one of six multiplicands and the one that varies least
# within a protocol. That is the physical reason TR alone scored 0.0%
# permutation importance — not a model defect. TF (turbo factor) was the last
# missing multiplicand and is now mapped.
#
# ST/TST are PARSED but DENYLISTED as features — see SUT_LEAKAGE_DENYLIST.
#
# The 2026-07-31 reading was that ST is decided BEFORE the measurement, so a
# planned value rather than an observed outcome, and therefore admissible. The
# 2026-08-04 call overrides that: 03c section E measured ST as exact on ~86-87%
# of rows, and a duration model handed a field that IS the answer 86% of the
# time learns identity instead of physics. Being computed pre-scan does not
# make it a legal input; it makes it a *second* copy of the target. 07 would
# also have to synthesise ST before it could generate with it, which is the
# same problem one step later.
#
# It stays in SUT_FIELD_MAP on purpose — 03c section E's ST-vs-duration
# diagnosis reads it out of sut_debug, and that work continues.
#
# (Note SLC x TR reproduces ST for haste (9 x 866ms -> ST:8; 15 x 1000ms ->
# ST:15) but NOT for ep2d_diff (18 x 4300ms = 77s vs ST:400) — a genuine
# per-family computation, which is precisely why it carries target information
# the individual fields do not.) Names stay as the raw message mnemonics.
#
# NOT here on purpose: DLL (sequence binary) and OR (orientation) are STRINGS.
# They are extracted separately in 03_build_preprocessed_pkl.py — a category id
# mixed into a scaled numeric vector is meaningless, and they need embeddings
# like sequence_type, not a divisor.

# (19.6s either way). As a predictor in its own right it scored R2 -19.6% /
# 72.5s MAE, WORSE than the serial-alone baseline (5.8% / 66.9s): the signature
# of a high-cardinality nuisance id, not a hidden protocol.
#
# Görtler described the mechanism unprompted in the same week's call, and it
# matches the measurement exactly: MUID is a per-day measurement counter that
# resets nightly and skips the ids consumed by adjustment scans, so it carries
# ordering information and nothing else.
#
# Denylisted anyway, per 03d's own verdict: a field that CAN leak should not be
# one retrain away from leaking. VER (scanner software version) is not a scan
# property at all — it splits the corpus by install, which lets a tree memorise
# per-site behaviour.
SUT_IDENTIFIER_DENYLIST = {'MUID', 'VER'}

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# THE THIRD OBJECTION, added 2026-08-07 after the Görtler meeting.
#
# His position is to pass every parameter and let the model work out which
# matter, because a model that hides fields from itself cannot reach the
# extraordinary 1%. That is right, and 03f agreed with it before he said it: the
# ranked top-12 beat both hand-picked sets. The reason a denylist survives that
# position is that "don't hide things from the model" is a claim about SCAN
# PHYSICS, and these fields are not physics.
#
#   SUT_LEAKAGE_DENYLIST        ~equal to the TARGET.
#   SUT_IDENTIFIER_DENYLIST     an IDENTITY that cannot transfer.
#   SUT_PLANNER_DERIVED_DENYLIST  a quantity the scanner COMPUTED FROM the
#                               timing it was about to run. Not the answer, and
#                               not an id — a re-expression of the answer.
#
# SNR is the seed and currently the only entry. The three real messages pinned
# in tests/test_sut_parser.py move it monotonically AGAINST scan time:
#
#     haste       SNR 87   ST   8
#     haste       SNR 69   ST  15
#     ep2d_diff   SNR 39   ST 400
#
# which is what MR physics predicts, since predicted SNR carries an acquisition-
# time term. n=3 is not proof, and there is a real counter-argument: if SNR is a
# deterministic function of parameters we already supply, it is REDUNDANT rather
# than leaky and costs nothing to include. The distinction turns on whether the
# console computes it before or after the operator's adjustments, which nobody
# in the 08-07 meeting could answer.
#
# So it is denied by DEFAULT and its exclusion carries a PRICE TAG: gate 4 of
# the parameter report scores the vector with and without this denylist on the
# grouped split and prints the difference. A denylist entry that cannot show
# what it costs is an assertion; one that can is a decision. If the measured
# cost is large and the grouped split shows no divergence, this entry should be
# removed — and the report is what tells us that.
SUT_PLANNER_DERIVED_DENYLIST = {'SNR'}

# NOT a denylist — a reading aid, migrated out of 03f_coverage_and_masking.py so
# it survives that notebook's archiving. These fields are ADMISSIBLE and stay in
# the vector; the report flags them wherever they rank high, so a suspect is
# noticed rather than admired.
#
# The test to apply, the same one that convicted ST: is this a re-expression of
# the answer, or a cause of it? A cause stays in, however strongly it correlates.
#
#   ACQW/TGD are absent from all three pinned messages (they ride gated
#   sequences), so nothing about them has been measured on our corpus yet. BHD
#   was the closest call on this list and is now SETTLED — see its entry.
SUT_SUSPECT_WATCHLIST = {
    # CLEARED 2026-08-11 by Görtler, and the reasoning is the general test this

    # measurement of one. Patients manage ~15-20s (dashboard: 15s and 18s
    # dominate, 25-30s very seldom), and the sequence is designed to FIT inside
    # that window. A bound the protocol was built to satisfy is a CAUSE of the
    # duration, not a re-expression of it — the same distinction that convicted
    # ST and acquitted MUID. Stays admitted; kept on the watchlist because it is
    # 19.5%-present and a future gate-5 spike would still be worth a look.

# ============================================================================
# THE VENDOR PARAMETER TABLE — what each MRI_SUT_1005 field actually IS.
#
# From `protocol_parameter_descriptions.xlsx`, sent by the MR sequence
# development department after the 2026-08-11 review. 188 parameters, each with
# a description and an authoritative isNumeric flag.
#
# This closes the single worst gap in the 08-11 report, which had to say "122
# admitted fields have no entry in SUT_FIELD_MAP — we USE them but cannot say
# what they mean". Fine for training; blocking for step 07, which has to
# synthesise every field it conditions on and cannot reason about a name it has
# never seen.
#
# DELIBERATELY NOT MERGED INTO SUT_FIELD_MAP. That map decides a field's STABLE
# NAME, which is the identity of a column in the conditioning vector and in the
# divisor table — renaming `IPS` to `images_per_slab` would repoint every
# learned weight and invalidate the checkpoint for a cosmetic gain. Identity
# lives in SUT_FIELD_MAP; MEANING lives here. Keyed by the raw mnemonic, which
# is what the vendor ships.
#
# Two answers from the same review are recorded against the watchlist above
# rather than here, because they changed a decision rather than a label:
#   IPS = ImagesPerSlab. A 3D slab cut into N 2D images — so it is a genuine
#         count-of-images driver on 3D sequences (flash 3D, 3D VIBE), which is
#         exactly the shape of a duration cause. It ranks #2 in the 08-11
#         importance table and that now makes physical sense.
#   BHD = breathholdDuration, and it is NOT the target. Görtler: it is an UPPER
#         LIMIT per breath-hold step (patients manage ~15-20s), so the sequence
#         must fit inside it. A bound on duration is a cause of duration, not a
#         copy of it. It stays admitted.

# aligned-list arrangement it replaces could desync silently and needed an
# assert at the bottom of this file to catch it. Here a name cannot have a
# divisor without a default, or land at the wrong index.
#
# THE DIVISOR is not cosmetic. An unscaled large-magnitude numeric silently
# erases the categorical conditioning through LayerNorm — see the
# conditioning_scale warning in AlternatingPipeline/models/sequence_generator.py.
# That exact bug caused three separate multi-week flat-duration incidents in
# this project. Divisors come from the observed p99 (03b section 1's
# 'suggested divisor' column); step 03 re-checks each one against real data at
# write time and warns when p99/divisor lands outside [0.05, 20].
#
# THE MISSING DEFAULT matters just as much, and is why this table exists at
# all. _safe_float in step 03 and safe_float in
# AlternatingPipeline/training/utils.py both default an absent key to 0.0. For
# the multiplicative factors in the acquisition-time formula

#     TA ~= TR x PEL x AVG x CONC / (PAT x TF)

# of the formula and the physically correct reading — one average, one
# concatenation, no parallel-imaging acceleration, one echo per TR. A genuine
# measurement (TR, slice count, matrix lines) has no neutral value, so those
# keep 0.0 and the model learns the missing-ness.

# PRESENCE FLAGS — what makes "pass every parameter" actually work.
#
# Görtler (2026-08-07): pass everything and let the model sort it out, because a
# model that hides fields from itself cannot reach the extraordinary 1%. He is
# right, and the pipeline could not execute it, for a reason that is invisible
# from outside the code:
#
#   Every number in 03b-03f came from HistGradientBoostingRegressor, which has a
#   NATIVE THIRD STATE for a missing value and learns a split direction for it.
#   The model path has no such state. build_conditioning_tensor runs every value
#   through safe_float (AlternatingPipeline/training/utils.py:107), which turns
#   NaN into a real number. With 7 fields that is tolerable. With ~89 — most of
#   them sequence-family-scoped and therefore absent on most rows — the majority
#   of the vector becomes fabricated measurements, and LayerNorm then makes the
#   near-constant columns compete with the categorical embeddings for amplitude.
#   That is the exact mechanism behind this project's three multi-week
#   flat-duration incidents.
#
# A presence flag restores the third state in the one place it was missing. It
# also removes the hardest manual bottleneck: with a flag saying "this field was
# not in the message", the VALUE written for an absent field stops carrying
# meaning, so a newly discovered field needs a divisor but not a hand-classified
# missing default. Hand-classifying ~89 fields as multiplicative-or-measurement
# was the thing that made "use all" a week of guessing.
#
# The hand-curated defaults in SEQPARAM_CANDIDATES stay: they are correct, and
# they keep the vector sane if flags are ever switched off for an ablation.

# THE DISCOVERED FIELD TABLE — how PARAM_SET='all' gets ~89 fields without

#
# THE DIVISOR IS NOT COSMETIC (see the long note above SEQPARAM_CANDIDATES): an
# unscaled large-magnitude numeric erases the categorical conditioning through
# LayerNorm. So every field needs one, and picking them by hand was the
# bottleneck that kept the selected set at 7. Step 03 already computes p99 per
# field for its own divisor sanity check; it now WRITES that out, and this reads
# it back.
#
# Safe against desync by construction: `conditioning_scale` is a persistent
# buffer registered on the model (sequence_generator.py:172-178) and travels
# INSIDE the checkpoint, so a served model always receives the divisors it was
# trained with even if this table has moved on since. What a changed table CAN
# do is make two training runs incomparable, which is why

# THE FLOOR IS 0.0 SINCE 2026-08-11 — every numeric field the corpus contains
# reaches the model, ~170 of them where the 1% floor admitted 133.
#
# Decided in that morning's review, on the measurement rather than on either
# prior: 03b's gate 4b scored four arms (1% floor / presence-flags-only / 0.1% /
# 0.0%) on the 2,197 rows that actually carry a rare field, over five seeds, and
# they landed 13.49 / 13.96 / 14.03 / 14.06s against a ±1.28s spread. Nothing
# separates them. Given no measurable cost, the meeting took the option that
# keeps the data rather than the one that discards it — a digital twin aiming at
# the extraordinary 1% should not be hiding fields from itself, and the rule
# that excluded them was never validated, only inherited.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT SETTLE. "No measurable difference" at 10 serials is a
# statement about the corpus, not about the parameters; the same review kept
# more data as the fix and explicitly rejected re-weighting rare parameters to
# compensate. Re-read gate 4b after the 21-serial run — it is the first one with
# the counts to say something.
#
# THE COST IS DOWNSTREAM, NOT HERE. Every admitted field is one step 07 must
# synthesise, and at this floor that includes fields on one or two rows, where
# the (body_region, sequence_type) sampler has no distribution to draw from and
# its empty-pool fallback writes a fabricated 0.0. That is a real bill and 03b
# reports it; it is not a reason to re-narrow the training vector.

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# GÖRTLER'S <1% CHALLENGE, 2026-08-10 — the two knobs it added.
#
# He rejected the percentage floor with a concrete mechanism: PDM occurs almost
# only on cardiac sequences, so despite being vanishingly rare it may be a
# near-perfect INDICATOR of that family; and rare parameters belong to NEW
# sequence types whose share grows, so a static ratio ages badly.
#
# The evidence brought against him — "aggregate MSE rises when sub-1% fields are
# included" — cannot detect that claim. A field helping only the ~1% of rows it
# appears on moves aggregate MAE by a fraction of a second, inside seed noise.
# So both knobs below exist to be SWEPT, and the arms are scored per stratum in
# 03b. Neither default changes the incumbent field list.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# THE COUNT ESCAPE HATCH. Learnability tracks the absolute number of rows a
# field appears on; the percentage floor tracks a ratio that stays flat as the
# corpus grows. So a percentage-only rule gets HARDER to justify exactly as the
# data gets better — 40,000 occurrences is eminently learnable whatever fraction
# of the fleet that is.
#
# DISABLED BY DEFAULT (0 = never fires), and that is a deliberate choice rather
# than timidity. A hatch that is ON by default silently changes the shipped
# feature set: at 10 serials / ~51k sequences the 1% floor is ~510 rows, so a
# 500-row hatch would admit every field in the 0.98-1.0% band that the
# percentage floor rejects. Small, but it moves the INCUMBENT — and an arm sweep
# whose baseline moved is measuring two things at once.
#
# So the hatch ships as a knob the sweep turns on, not as a new default. Set it
# to a learnability floor (500 is a reasonable start) to score it as an arm, and
# promote it to a default once the corpus is large enough that the decision is
# backed by a measurement rather than by this comment.

# sequences so this might help the model IDENTIFY heart sequences" is a claim
# about a field's PRESENCE, not its VALUE. A 0/1 indicator is learnable from far
# fewer rows than a continuous slope, so dropping the field wholesale discards

# SOURCE BOOTSTRAP — how a notebook gets an importable AlternatingPipeline.

# THE FAILURE THIS REPLACES. Until 2026-08-21 there were three different
# answers to that question in one pipeline:
#
#   04  copied the Workspace tree to /tmp/alternating_pipeline_src itself.
#   05  and 06 did NOT copy anything — they sys.path.insert'd that same /tmp
#       directory and imported, relying on 04 having run on the same machine.
#   07  cloned the git repo to /tmp/tsm and imported from there.
#
# So 05 and 06 were the only two that could not stand on their own, and on
# 2026-08-21 both died reporting EVERY module missing, after a training run
# that had itself succeeded — 04 ran on a GPU cluster, the analysis did not,
# and /tmp is per-machine. The guard below then misdiagnosed it as a stale
# copy, because it had no way to tell "copied too early" from "never copied
# here at all".
#
# A notebook that depends on another notebook's side effect in /tmp is not
# reproducible. This function is the one answer: it is idempotent, it refreshes
# itself, and it does not care what has or has not run before it.
#
# Lives in config.py because config.py is %run-loaded straight from the
# Workspace by every notebook and is therefore always current — the same
