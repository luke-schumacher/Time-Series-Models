Me: Hi. Good morning. Gosh. January is already over. Crazy. I You're Pretty well, I think. I'm not sure if Stefano is gonna join, but I emailed him. Let's see. Not much. Hi, Georg. Hi, It's good. We are together on three. I think they are join next week. Okay. Be back in Monday I sensed the Stefano the meeting details on Wednesday again, but he hasn't replied yet. So let's see if he joins or not. Okay. So sounds good. Yeah. One topic from my side. Yesterday, I got a a our digital twins Hi. Hi. Hi. New Year. Hi. Post Neues. Paul is Yes? Yeah. So just thought to tell that at MR. I want to they are and potential trends that we are doing like examination sequence of sequence. Prediction is something which might be interesting, but also the other digital terms that we are doing And I said, we we can go to a team meeting. They wanted to invite us into a team meeting that we can show I wouldn't prefer to do it not now. Do it in some weeks. Because we should bring our information better together, let's say, in in in PowerPoints, what we have, and also our models we are just in an changing phase. Yeah. We want to use the new data and and we have to consider all the information and what we are using now. Yeah. Clearing clarity. Do we extract from the event log and which data do we use for Now the goal, I think Let's get clear what is the data. That's good. I think yeah. I think my my plan I'm still working on some of the presentations. So I think I can I can give a short demo presentation maybe, like, 10 slides by by Monday or something, and then we can review if if if that covers what we're we're doing, and it also helps for the onboarding for NFED? Our new working student. And we can go over it and then kind of work a little bit on it and that's that should be fine. Okay. Because we also have to change the say, I'll relieve So we should exactly define what we And then yeah, start that very soon with the new Okay. I Yeah. That's that's fine. I think this Okay. More interested, I think. But I think it was from Martina. She When we have two different models. All the columns and then we discussed which columns are used in which model. And how can we Yeah. Because that we have the patient weight, age, height, and but mainly in the interaction with our system we have the direction how the patient is It's which is interacting to the to the patient exchange model, for example, but it could also have an influence of As of someone is should fit together. So so If we If you make an examination, for example, we have a knee examination the patient a, and the next should then be a patient exchange So from patient a to patient b which might be a different should be a different patient And we want to do a head examination with the new patient. Then we have an exchange from knee to head. Which should be predicted. Yeah. What are the steps? To do? And then the next step of examination should be ahead of examination. And Luke showed us combined model where everything was mixed up, so during the examination, and and and if you look at the time, and it was not synchronized. Produce one output like one patient dissemination. Mhmm. Exactly. One of which exchange. And then after that, another patient examination should happen. But then we need some parameters like food or some that the model knows now we might is another patient who needs a pact What happens on a day terms of patients, for this, I I said we can just we should at first use ground truth patient objectives, let's say, or which you train the model take a day look at the the patient's to generate what the machine does or what is done during the examination and during So modeling, what happens? On a day in terms of which patients come to the to the site. This is a very And we postponed that because it's much simpler and not so interesting, maybe It will be interesting at the end when we want to generate a day completely synthetic Okay. Yeah. But it's okay. I'm right, I think. Way. Yeah. Come to decide when and or the exchange phase. It's So actually, you can just predict in advance for any exchange you have at for customer or whatever, and for every audio region that is to be examined or audio region transition or whatever. And from the patient transferring and any sample of stem subset. It's the same. It doesn't really matter if you of or an armature I I kind of sorry to interrupt. Your next exchange phase, though, that you can interrupt. Come in because they at the past, we had And because if you have a knee, and this will take forty five minutes. Yeah. That's kind of what I wanted to discuss is kind of how I organize the the flow for now and and specifically what needs to change based on what we have discussed Because the the input I have I have at least some new and updated data for both the sequence and the patient exchange model. Then I have this temporal model that that looks at the the duration and kind of the timestamps for each session and patient. And then I did implement the patient conditioning, but I think that's a bit ahead of what we're planning to do. And that also doesn't really 100% work as of but that's kind of how I wanted to plan it. And looking at the age, weight, height, all those kind of different things, body group from and to, And then doing the tokenization for and outputting the token sequence for the patient exchange. As in from start all the way to start to to end. And then having another model look at the duration for that for that time, And then combining that with the sequence model same with the tokenization, and then also the duration. And then somehow combining that in the output. What we have And I know there are some things that need to be corrected, and I'm wondering what the structure should kinda look like in our our final final output and and what needs to change. So, hey, here is the One. Step on how is it supposed to to slow? I'm not 100% sure if I understood it. So let's What is this This is, let's say, the whole model. What you you wanted? And then what do you want to to generate? The the whole day? Yes. Yes. As an example, this is yeah, kind of And then then there I I guess there is the a minute ago, that the model should work like we have where we can And then we have a transition from the pseudo body region start to the first body region level to be examined on that day. It doesn't matter if it's the starting phase, end phase, or some exchange phase between we should have a model that learn to sample the the steps in between. And the the idea would then be to if you want to have a whole day from ground patients, then sequence data then you give in all these patient information sequentially This determines how many examinations happen on the day, how many in between phases there there will be And as I said, we will model later, not yet. Must run it in a sequential alternating order. So the first thing you need to do is, okay, I'm at the start. So I call my exchange model, with start to the to the next body reach, and this will be given because we have the whole patient sequence And then this model produces us a sample of the initial stage of the starting stage And we are at the position of being able to examine the first patient with a given body reach. Mhmm. Then we call the next model for examination model, that body region. And with the the same steps of Are coming from this start to the body reached the state. Condition. And now want to sample an examination. Then we do that. And then this happens in in a sequential order. So we always have to look at that ahead at the next patient. What what is the what will be examined this, we have this transition. Conditions And that you And then you call the exchange model again with the last body reach two end body reach information. And then you should see some kind of result. Sequence or whatever is done Yeah. I mean, think the question I have now is we don't really have kind of the puzzle pieces that match together. Like, we don't have the exact same sequence data as we have for the patient exchange data. So we might have a lot of patient exchanges, but we don't have the specific sequence that happen at the time of that exchange. Is is that something that we necessarily need, or or can that Did did I'm sorry. I got it. The the what do you what don't you have? No. Because, like Because you you have the sequence form. Patients. Yes. And and does it all that matter matter for the firm? Because actually, we are anyway, we are Duration. And currently, it doesn't matter if if the model starts at the a given time at 02:00 in the night or 07:00 in the morning. It's we need to set it, and then have some time depending on that. But actually, we just have duration. But that will be another step of course, if we want to have it on a on on on such a basis. But I'm not sure. It depends, I guess. I guess, some customers nine and not time depending. That depending. What could depend on on the on the starting date is there, of course, patient There will be the machine doesn't care if it's Monday or Friday or Saturday. It should always react in the same way That's why it's built that way. But But but do we predict a schedule for one of the specific customers, or is it is it a schedule that it has learned from all the customers combined? For the first initial step? And, currently, we are we are modeling anyway on customer basis. Any customer has one whole one creative model consulting or several other. Models, all More or less be a little Just the the the debt give the model the steps that are done during the exchange phases, then you will only be able to see and predict on after them for the start up phase. Don't appear in the exchange basis then maybe it's even a good idea to have other more separate that. Georg, you you know that much better What is done in which phase? I think so at the beginning, we are starting with an customer specific model. Because we want to see the characteristic of each customer. That we can model a customer. And the next step, it it will it that's the ninth coding, these things the next year. This year will be core running, it will be very easy now nowadays. To go steps further and and then say, okay. Now we don't want to have one model for a customer, but we want to have a model for all the customers. But then we need to think about how do we encounter these customers because we can't tell its customer machine for the 18, for the nine or something that. Like that. This won't have much, I guess, You then, of course, would maybe trade to all the customers that you could make to mix them up, but whatever, future, goal. Then exchange to to different systems and but my question before I have to go small precise, if we really want to get in the features. For example, like we said, a patient model, My understanding is that from the beginning of this starting this model, you have this whole day training, and and to the end, we I wanted to have one big sheet, let's say, like an x sheet. There's a lot of columns there. Steps for patient exchange, yeah, which which you would model in. And time points. Yeah? And and this is what we also want if we want to touch this model at the end, it's not that we are looking only at the Is it running in a way that we would say, okay. It's similar to what we see from a customer Yeah. Let's say 100 colors, Every model is predicting this part, and over the day, And if you go at the entry, what to compare independent, that we have to know if a result is good or not. So And that's the reason why I wanted to have have clear which parameters do we have parameters that we have that we can look at the parameters in our dashboards, for example, And and that is why Martina is I get that sort of the reason for the for the whole presentation is not to go too much into the details, I guess. But to tell the whole story or the overarching goal, for this, I'm with you. I wouldn't go into the details for the models because the whole world around program though The whole architecture is because we were in in the way that we can work together as a team of us in limited time, and this will be by effect of iron ore It will be and not about the technical programming Vibe Vibe coding. we do it now, and that's our running prototype, but I'm quite sure that this whole architecture in the middle would be different. So let's tell them the the the home picture. Okay. Understood. Yeah. But but for the dashboards, what we want to show because the dashboards give I'll I'll go the the specific metrics and so forth. And that they don't care about the model architecture, but any model architecture architecture produces these metrics and then we can compare So we have to define it. We have effort idea was to use dashboards but then you can only do it if you train the model and ask the numbers there. Visible and even make some calculations the dashboard more flexible because Yeah. We can want to look more deeper into the data or a drop down to to individual cases where we have some problems. And therefore, because I have to to leave now. Please make sure that we have a clear picture which columns, yeah, which which parameters are input and output parameters, that we are using and what we want to predict, and and at the end, we can show the real world and and a predicted world and can compare it with Lattachport, for example. From the day I think, or 11 countries. And this is 60 customers in a country, maybe Okay. I thank you for my from my side. I take this this other day. You're welcome. And now you're Yeah. Yeah. But I just wanted to clarify for, I think, the core picture is I mean, this is this is essentially what we have for the patient exchange model. And we're currently using the source IDs and we have the duration as in the time difference. And, yeah, we have coil elements. We also have patient from two. We have the weight, age, height, and and direction. But for the core for the core model now, do we only need this? Or do we also want to combine it? With with the following data, which includes the actual sequences. That's kind of my question. Like, what what should the core model now output that we then need for for the other models to com complete the picture. Because I was going on a on a trajectory, which was training the sequence model, training the training the patient ex change model, and then having an a separate temporal model try to piece those things together, but I don't think that's the right way. No. We do not model any any dependent any dependence between two patients on a day except for this body two region or something like that. So that defines But actually, it doesn't really matter if these body two regions or whatever, so the patient ID the patient information. What conditions, the the the the phase of the if they are done, this is why you can think of kind of buckets. You can just think about this body. From two buckets. Okay. And then you can produce a and you should you should produce all the buckets you can bucket or 1,000 per bucket, And you need to do that to get a metric how well that fits to the actual trading data or to the gas data. So in order to validate these two models, we need to do that anyway. But to combine these models then would they give sequence patients, at the day, we can we don't even need to rerun the models We can't just pick random samples of these already generated samples. Because the if we take the model again, it will also just generate such a number and it doesn't really really matter if you run the model again or if we take one of the 1,000 outlets for this body two, reach. So in the end, to generate a a day of data for a given ground truth, pay sequence that was on that have that one that they You just as I said, you just go through these you just produce these transition information start to brain. Brain to knee knee to head. Head to abdomen. Whatever And then for any of these transitions, take either the examination sample or exchange sample depending on whether there is currently an exchange phase or an examination And that's it. So so the in a in in essence, the the actual source IDs matter a lot less than the body part exchanges that occur within the given day frame. Day time frame. So the both ID date would be generated by the by the examination model. Mhmm. And they what happens in the examination before? Before currently doesn't happen an effect in the modeling of the next could be tricky because if the first if the examination because of a failure that to to get a more realistic model that could that can also capture rather abnormal whatever. Yeah. But, again, step by step. Mhmm. To produce results currently it's really just changing samples for for the transition types that you get from the ground through and then the next step will be we don't want to have these ground truth bodies. Patient sequences for a day. We want to have some kind of model that will be different. Than the other ones that we currently had, I guess, It's a Monday in patient this patient will these patients will come today. Probably, this is an example of the patients that are to be expected you chain again the other you would Okay. Okay. I think that gets me gets me further than reforesoil. Thank you. Okay. Think so far, don't really have any other questions, and I I'm I think I'm good. Me just have one if to make the output drug. Right? Because then you need to use them there for course. But this will be, let's say, given set and given from the training date of for these customers because then you collect all the the events that happened there and then seen such an event before. And then that's it. And to make the the model so that the model doesn't need to you know, and that's it's So this is already in the model, and because the model doesn't use you can't use the two of the the number two as an output over 600. from the patient exchange model and put them together talkings again and with the same kind of conditions. They are they are some cancer patients. And the rest so what can be generated by these models are the the steps and the the times So they will be they will be trained on these items. And then, of course, you need these items. In comparison way comparing the real data, Okay. Information not just for the patient. Right now, but also for the next patient or something because we have these body wrong too and but I mean, it's just on the on any other level, like what happened as she told us told us in terms of sequence IDs or whatever. Think that makes it the things what you Okay. Yeah. And then the patient exchange model Course, you will have some information about the COVID. That not unplugged in I'm not sure how they are encoded in the event look. If they are more social not sure And the the z axis and y axis stuff is the orientation. From the Yeah. So it does does also like depending or examination depending what is to be done Look at the Okay. You're not I Okay. You know? I can definitely use it. So that would be helpful. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Thank you. I'll just Okay. I I think like the project so much.
